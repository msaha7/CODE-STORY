          <h2>Chapter 1: Beginning the day</h2>  
          <p> Welp, Its already 8:02am and I realized I had a 8am class today.
          </p>
          <p> So in such a sorrowful mood, I had to come to terms with me having to go to class and dragging myself out of bed and throwing something on and start heading to class
          </p>
          <p> I cleaned myself up in like 5 mins and I put on my sweats and sweater and started to head out of my dorm at 9:08am tired.
    </p>  
    <p> I was starting to get hunger but food needed to come later cause I know I still had a chance of getting marked present for class since I who the professor sometimes takes attendence late.
    </p>
    <p> As I walked into class as they were taking attendance so i knew I was safe. So I had to start on my day now.
