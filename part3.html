        <h1>The cooldown of the day</h1>
          <h2>Chapter 3: The Winding down part</h2>  
          <p> After eating at the Dining hall hopefully filled up with good food, I start walking back to Courtyard where my dorm is located thinking about whether i have enough time to hit the gym
          </p>
          <p> In a such a Gun Ho mood, I decide to go to the gym cause I didn't have THAT much homework. So I proceed to hit my Chest and Triceps day for an hour or so. 
          </p>
          <p> Leaving with a good pump feeling, I make it back home to my dorm and take a nice warm shower and get my compy pants on start to get to work on my homework for the week.
          </p>  
          <p> After I put a good amount of work into some assignment, I switch to relax mode and turn on a TV show or something and enjoy the night.
          </p>
          <p> Then after looking at my phone and realzing its already 12, I turn off everything and hit they hay hoping thursday wont be stressfull. THE END
