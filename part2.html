          <h2>Chapter 2: Trying to survive</h2>  
          <p> Today is Wednesday so that means i wont be able to rest until 6PM. I have a total of 5 draining classes. 
          </p>
          <p> I have a 8am, 9am, 12am, 1pm, then a 3pm. I cannot take a nap or anything between my 9 and 12 because I need food inside of me after my 9am which usually ends me at 11am after eating
          </p>
          <p> So its 11ish and I have nothing to do for like an hour so I normally do some homework or watch a show until my 12 and 1 pm classes starts while still trying to get into the correct headspace
          </p>  
          <p> Normally after those 2 classes I am feelinf better and actually in a good mood so I wait around with a friend until our 3pm starts in SCE
          </p>
          <p> The after my long 3ish hour class I say goodbye to my friend and starts heading back to SCE where I'll get some dinner in the dining hall.
